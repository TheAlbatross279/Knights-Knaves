A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bart and Mel.  Bart claims, 'Both I am a knight and Mel is a knave.'  Mel tells you, 'I would tell you that Bart is a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
