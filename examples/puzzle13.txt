A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bart and Ted.  Bart claims, 'I and Ted are both knights or both knaves.'  Ted tells you, 'Bart would tell you that I am a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
