A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Marge and Zoey.  Marge says, 'Zoey and I are both knights or both knaves.'  Zoey claims, 'Marge and I are the same.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
