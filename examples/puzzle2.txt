A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Peggy and Zippy.  Peggy tells you that 'of Zippy and I, exactly one is a knight'.  Zippy tells you that only a knave would say that Peggy is a knave.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
