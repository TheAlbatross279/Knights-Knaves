A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Zed and Alice. Zed tells you, `I am a knight or Alice is a knave.' Alice tells you, `Of Zed and I, exactly one is a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
