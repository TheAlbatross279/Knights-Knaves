A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bob and Ted.  Bob says, 'I am a knight or Ted is a knave.'  Ted says that only a knave would say that Bob is a knave.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
