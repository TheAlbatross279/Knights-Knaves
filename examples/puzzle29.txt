A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Carl and Betty.  Carl says, 'Neither Betty nor I are knaves.'  Betty claims, 'Carl and I are the same.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
