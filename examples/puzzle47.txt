A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Peggy and Joe.  Peggy tells you, 'Joe is a knave.'  Joe claims that of Peggy and I, exactly one is a knight.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
