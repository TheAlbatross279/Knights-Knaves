A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Abe and Homer.  Abe tells you that Homer is a knave.  Homer says, 'Abe could say that I am a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
