A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bart and Sally.  Bart tells you, 'Sally and I are not the same.'  Sally tells you, 'I could claim that Bart is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
