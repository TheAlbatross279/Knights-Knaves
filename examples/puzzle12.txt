A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bob and Betty.  Bob claims that Betty is a knave.  Betty tells you, 'I am a knight or Bob is a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
