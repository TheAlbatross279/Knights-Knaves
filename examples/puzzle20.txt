A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Zed and Zoey.  Zed says that it's false that Zoey is a knave.  Zoey claims, 'I and Zed are different.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
