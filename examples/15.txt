A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Betty and Peggy. Betty tells you that Peggy is a knave. Peggy tells you, `Betty and I are both knights.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
