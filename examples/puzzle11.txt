A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Zed and Bart.  Zed says, 'Bart is a knight or I am a knight.'  Bart tells you, 'Zed could claim that I am a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
