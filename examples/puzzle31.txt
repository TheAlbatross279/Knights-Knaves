A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Abe and Bozo.  Abe says, 'I and Bozo are not the same.'  Bozo tells you, 'I am a knight or Abe is a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
