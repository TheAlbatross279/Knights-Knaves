A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Alice and Zed.  Alice tells you, 'At least one of the following is true: that Zed is a knave or that I am a knight.'  Zed says, 'It's not the case that Alice is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
