A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bob and Mel.  Bob tells you, 'At least one of the following is true: that I am a knight or that Mel is a knave.'  Mel claims, 'Only a knave would say that Bob is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
