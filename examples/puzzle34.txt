A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Marge and Homer.  Marge claims, 'I would tell you that Homer is a knight.'  Homer tells you that Marge is a knave.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
