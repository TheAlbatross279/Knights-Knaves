A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Carl and Bill.  Carl says, 'I and Bill are both knights or both knaves.'  Bill claims, 'Only a knave would say that Carl is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
