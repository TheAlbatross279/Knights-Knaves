A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Alice and Ted. Alice tells you, `Either Ted is a knave or I am a knight.' Ted tells you, `Of I and Alice, exactly one is a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
