A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Ted and Zeke.  Ted claims, 'Zeke could say that I am a knave.'  Zeke claims that it's not the case that Ted is a knave.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
