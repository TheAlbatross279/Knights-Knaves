A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Zed and Bob.  Zed says, 'Both I am a knight and Bob is a knave.'  Bob says, 'Zed could say that I am a knight.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
