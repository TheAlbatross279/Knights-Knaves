A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Sally and Ted.  Sally says, 'I and Ted are different.'  Ted says, 'I and Sally are both knights or both knaves.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
