A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Peggy and Carl.  Peggy tells you that only a knave would say that Carl is a knave.  Carl tells you, 'Peggy and I are different.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
