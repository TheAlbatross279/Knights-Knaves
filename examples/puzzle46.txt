A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Homer and Abe.  Homer claims that it's false that Abe is a knave.  Abe tells you, 'I could claim that Homer is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
