A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Alice and Zippy.  Alice says, 'Zippy and I are not the same.'  Zippy claims, 'I am a knight or Alice is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
