A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Peggy and Alice.  Peggy says, 'I and Alice are both knights or both knaves.'  Alice says, 'Peggy and I are the same.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
