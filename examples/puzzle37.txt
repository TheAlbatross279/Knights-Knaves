A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Bob and Sally.  Bob tells you, 'At least one of the following is true: that I am a knight or that Sally is a knave.'  Sally says, 'I would tell you that Bob is a knave.'

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
