A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

You meet two inhabitants: Mel and Ted. Mel tells you, `Either Ted is a knight or I am a knight.' Ted tells you that Mel is a knave.

Can you determine who is a knight and who is a knave?
